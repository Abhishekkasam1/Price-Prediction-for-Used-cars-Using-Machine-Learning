# Price-Prediction-for-Used-cars-Using-Machine-Learning
The price of a new car in the industry is fixed by the manufacturer with 
some additional costs incurred by the Government in the form of taxes. So, 
customers buying a new car can be assured of the money they invest to be 
worthy. But, due to the increased prices of new cars and the financial 
incapability of the customers to buy them, Used Car sales are on a global 
increase. Therefore, there is an urgent need for a Used Car Price Prediction 
system which effectively determines the worthiness of the car using a 
variety of features. 
Our results show that Random Forest model yield the best results, but are 
compute heavy. Conventional linear regression also yielded satisfactory 
results, with the advantage of a significantly lower training time in 
comparison to the aforementioned methods
